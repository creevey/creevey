# Comprehensive Architecture Diagram Plan

## Requirements Analysis

- Core Requirements:

  - [x] Document all major components of the Creevey system
  - [x] Illustrate interactions and data flows between components
  - [x] Show integration with external systems (Storybook, browsers, etc.)
  - [x] Highlight architectural patterns used in the system
  - [x] Document the technology stack used in each component

- Technical Constraints:
  - [x] Diagram should be readable and not overly complex
  - [x] Use industry-standard notation where appropriate
  - [x] Include multiple levels of abstraction (overview and detailed views)
  - [x] Diagram should be maintainable and updatable
  - [x] Use Mermaid or similar tools for diagram generation

## Component Analysis

- Components to Include:

  - Server Components
    - Test orchestration subsystem
    - Worker management
    - WebDriver integration (Selenium/Playwright)
    - Docker integration
    - Image comparison engine
    - Configuration management
    - Story providers
    - WebSocket server
  - Client Components
    - UI Runner
    - Test visualization
    - Image comparison visualization
    - Test management interface
    - WebSocket client
  - Storybook Integration
    - Storybook addon
    - Story discovery
    - Test generation
    - Channel-based communication
  - External Components
    - Docker containers
    - Browser instances
    - CI/CD systems

## Design Decisions

- Architecture Diagrams to Create:

  - [x] High-level System Overview
    - Show major subsystems and their relationships
    - Include external systems and integration points
  - [x] Component Interaction Diagram
    - Illustrate communication between components
    - Show message flows and protocols
  - [x] Data Flow Diagram
    - Trace the flow of data through the system
    - Show how test data, images, and results are processed
  - [x] Deployment Diagram
    - Show how components are deployed
    - Illustrate Docker container usage
  - [x] Technology Stack Diagram
    - Document technologies used in each component
    - Show dependencies and frameworks

## Implementation Strategy

1. Phase 1: Research and Planning

   - [x] Gather information from existing documentation
   - [x] Review codebase to verify component relationships
   - [x] Select appropriate diagram tools and formats
   - [x] Define diagram scope and boundaries

2. Phase 2: High-level Architecture Diagrams

   - [x] Create system overview diagram
   - [x] Create component interaction diagram
   - [x] Review and refine high-level diagrams

3. Phase 3: Detailed Component Diagrams

   - [x] Create WebDriver architecture diagram
   - [x] Create UI architecture diagram
   - [x] Create test execution flow diagram
   - [x] Create Docker integration diagram
   - [x] Create Storybook integration diagram

4. Phase 4: Integration and Documentation
   - [x] Integrate all diagrams into a comprehensive document
   - [x] Add explanatory text and annotations
   - [x] Review and refine final architecture documentation

## Creative Phase Planning

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design (Primary Creative Phase)

Key design questions to address:

- How to represent the complex relationships between components?
- What level of detail is appropriate for each subsystem?
- How to clearly show the different paths for Selenium vs Playwright?
- What's the best way to illustrate the worker orchestration?
- How to represent the communication between Storybook and Creevey?

Deliverables:

- Multiple-level architecture diagrams
- Component relationship documentation
- Interface specifications

### üé® Visual Design for Diagrams

Key design questions:

- What visual language to use for the diagrams?
- How to use color and shapes to improve readability?
- What level of visual detail is appropriate?

Deliverables:

- Visual style guide for diagrams
- Color coding scheme for component types
- Template for consistent diagram elements

## Documentation Plan

- [x] Create README for the architecture documentation
- [x] Document diagram conventions and notation
- [x] Create explanatory text for each diagram
- [x] Link diagrams to relevant code sections
- [x] Add architecture overview to main project documentation

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All major components included in diagrams
- [x] Component relationships accurately represented
- [x] Data flows clearly illustrated
- [x] Integration points with external systems documented
- [x] Technology stack accurately depicted
- [x] Diagrams are clear and readable
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and understandable

## Next Steps

‚úÖ Completed:

1. High-level system overview diagram
2. Component interaction diagram
3. Detailed subsystem diagrams
4. Integration of all diagrams into comprehensive documentation
