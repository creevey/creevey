# Exploration Plan

## Overview

Following our complexity assessment (Level 3) and planning phase, we need a structured approach to explore and document the key components of Creevey. This document outlines our exploration plan with specific focus areas and methodologies.

## Exploration Areas

### 1. WebDriver Implementation

**Objective**: Understand how Creevey abstracts and implements different WebDriver technologies.

**Key Files to Examine**:

- `src/server/webdriver.ts`
- `src/server/selenium/`
- `src/server/playwright/`

**Questions to Answer**:

- How does Creevey abstract WebDriver interfaces?
- What are the differences between Selenium and Playwright implementations?
- How are browser sessions managed and reused?
- How are screenshots captured across different browsers?
- How is error handling and retry logic implemented?

### 2. Test Execution Flow

**Objective**: Map the complete flow from test discovery to execution and reporting.

**Key Files to Examine**:

- `src/server/index.ts`
- `src/server/worker/`
- `src/server/stories.ts`
- `src/server/messages.ts`

**Questions to Answer**:

- How are stories discovered and loaded?
- How are tests generated from stories?
- How is parallel execution orchestrated?
- How are test results aggregated and reported?
- How is hot-reloading implemented?

### 3. UI Runner Architecture

**Objective**: Understand the React-based UI implementation and communication patterns.

**Key Files to Examine**:

- `src/client/web/`
- `src/client/web/CreeveyApp.tsx`
- `src/client/web/CreeveyView/`

**Questions to Answer**:

- How is the UI component hierarchy structured?
- How does the UI communicate with the server?
- How is test state managed in the UI?
- How are image comparison visualizations implemented?
- How is real-time test status communicated?

### 4. Docker Integration

**Objective**: Understand how Docker is used for browser isolation.

**Key Files to Examine**:

- `src/server/docker.ts`
- Docker-related configuration

**Questions to Answer**:

- How are Docker containers managed?
- How are browser images specified and pulled?
- How is networking configured between Creevey and containers?
- How are resources allocated and cleaned up?

### 5. Image Comparison

**Objective**: Understand screenshot capture and comparison algorithms.

**Key Files to Examine**:

- Files related to screenshot capture and comparison
- Image processing code

**Questions to Answer**:

- How are images captured and stored?
- What algorithms are used for comparison?
- How are image differences visualized?
- How are thresholds and tolerances configured?

## Methodology

### For Each Component Area:

1. **Code Reading**: Examine source files to understand implementation details
2. **Documentation Review**: Consult existing documentation for guidance
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify key dependencies and their usage
4. **Interface Mapping**: Document public interfaces and contracts
5. **Flow Diagramming**: Create flow diagrams for complex processes
6. **Documentation**: Create technical documentation in the Memory Bank

### Documentation Format for Each Component:

- **Overview**: Brief description of the component's purpose
- **Key Classes/Interfaces**: Primary types and their responsibilities
- **Flow Diagram**: Visual representation of processes
- **Key Dependencies**: External libraries and internal dependencies
- **Configuration Options**: Available configuration parameters
- **Usage Examples**: How the component is typically used
- **Extension Points**: How the component can be extended or customized

## Timeline

| Phase | Focus Area               | Estimated Duration |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1     | WebDriver Implementation | 3-5 days           |
| 2     | Test Execution Flow      | 3-5 days           |
| 3     | UI Runner Architecture   | 3-5 days           |
| 4     | Docker Integration       | 2-3 days           |
| 5     | Image Comparison         | 2-3 days           |

## Deliverables

For each exploration area, we will produce:

1. A detailed technical document in the Memory Bank
2. Flow diagrams for complex processes
3. Interface documentation
4. Usage examples
5. Configuration guides

## Success Criteria

Our exploration will be considered successful when:

1. We have documented all key components and their interactions
2. We understand the implementation details of core functionality
3. We can explain the end-to-end flow of test execution
4. We have identified potential areas for improvement
5. We have created comprehensive technical documentation
