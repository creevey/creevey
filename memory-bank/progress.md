## Current Tasks

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Address critical technical debt
  - [ ] Update outdated dependencies
  - [ ] Improve error handling
  - [ ] Enhance test coverage
  - [ ] Refactor method names in TestsManager for consistency

## Potential Improvements

- Enhance test parallelization for faster execution
- Implement better error reporting for failed tests
- Add support for more browsers
- Improve UI responsiveness for large test suites

## Technical Debt

- Update dependencies to latest versions
- Refactor WebDriver integration for better maintainability
- Improve test result data structure
