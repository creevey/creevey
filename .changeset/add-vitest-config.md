Add Vitest configuration

- Replace webpack.config.mjs with vite.config.mts and vitest.config.mts in .npmignore
- Add vitest.config.mts to TypeScript includes
- Create basic vitest.config.mts configuration file

This change sets up Vitest as the testing framework, moving away from Webpack toward Vite-based tooling.
