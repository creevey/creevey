## üìã WORKFLOW PHASES

### Phase 1: INITIALIZATION (Output from VAN Mode)

This phase is largely completed in VAN mode, which identifies the task as Level 3.

  * **Input:** User request leading to an "Intermediate Feature" classification.
  * **Key Existing Files (from VAN):**
      * `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Entry created, complexity set to Level 3.
      * `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Initial context set.
      * Relevant Core Rules loaded (e.g., `Core/memory-bank-paths.mdc`, `Core/main-optimized.mdc`).
  * **Steps within this Workflow File (Confirmation):**
    1.  Confirm task is Level 3 by checking `memory-bank/tasks.md`.
    2.  Ensure core Memory Bank structure and paths are known (AI should have internalized from `main` rule).
  * **Milestone Checkpoint:**
    ```
    ‚úì INITIALIZATION CONFIRMED (L3)
    - Task correctly identified as Level 3 in tasks.md? [YES/NO]
    - Core Memory Bank files (tasks.md, activeContext.md) accessible via canonical paths? [YES/NO]

    ‚Üí If all YES: Proceed to Documentation Setup for L3.
    ‚Üí If any NO: Revisit VAN mode or core file setup.
    ```

### Phase 2: DOCUMENTATION SETUP (L3 Specific)

Prepare the Memory Bank for a Level 3 feature.

```mermaid
graph TD
    StartDoc["Begin L3 Documentation<br>Setup"] --> LoadL3PlanTrack["Load L3 Planning & Tracking Rules<br>Level3/planning-comprehensive.mdc<br>Level3/task-tracking-intermediate.mdc"]
    LoadL3PlanTrack --> UpdateBrief["Review/Update `projectbrief.md`<br>Ensure feature aligns with overall project goals"]
    UpdateBrief --> UpdateActiveCtx["Update `activeContext.md`<br>Set focus to L3 Feature Planning"]
    UpdateActiveCtx --> PrepTaskFile["Prepare `tasks.md` for<br>Comprehensive Feature Plan sections"]
    PrepTaskFile --> DocSetupComplete["L3 Documentation<br>Setup Complete"]

    style StartDoc fill:#b3e5fc,stroke:#81d4fa
    style DocSetupComplete fill:#81d4fa,stroke:#4fc3f7
```

  * **Steps:**
    1.  Load Level 3 specific planning (`Level3/planning-comprehensive.mdc`) and task tracking (`Level3/task-tracking-intermediate.mdc`) rules.
    2.  Review `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Briefly note the new feature if it impacts the overall brief.
    3.  Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Set current focus to "Level 3 Feature Planning: [Feature Name]".
    4.  Ensure `memory-bank/tasks.md` is ready for the detailed planning sections outlined in `Level3/planning-comprehensive.mdc`.
  * **Milestone Checkpoint:**
    ```
    ‚úì L3 DOCUMENTATION SETUP CHECKPOINT
    - L3 Planning & Tracking rules loaded? [YES/NO]
    - projectbrief.md reviewed/updated for feature context? [YES/NO]
    - activeContext.md reflects focus on L3 feature planning? [YES/NO]

```

  * **Steps:**
    1.  Define detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the feature.
    2.  Perform component analysis: identify new components to build and existing ones that will be modified. Map their interactions.
    3.  Develop an implementation strategy: outline the main steps or stages for building the feature.
    4.  Identify dependencies (technical, data, other features) and potential risks, along with mitigation ideas.
    5.  **Critical for L3:** Explicitly identify and flag parts of the feature that require CREATIVE mode (e.g., specific UI/UX challenges, new architectural patterns for the feature, complex algorithms).
    6.  Document the complete plan (requirements, components, strategy, dependencies, risks, creative flags) in `memory-bank/tasks.md` under the Level 3 feature task entry.
  * **Milestone Checkpoint:**
    ```
