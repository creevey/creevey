# PHASED IMPLEMENTATION FOR LEVEL 4 TASKS

> **TL;DR:** This document outlines a structured phased implementation approach for Level 4 (Complex System) tasks, ensuring controlled, incremental delivery of complex systems with appropriate verification at each phase.

## üîç PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

Level 4 Complex System tasks require a controlled, incremental approach to implementation to manage complexity, reduce risk, and ensure quality. This document outlines a phased implementation methodology that divides complex system development into discrete, verifiable phases with clear entry and exit criteria.

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PHASING PRINCIPLES

1. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Each phase delivers tangible, verifiable value.
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Complexity increases gradually across phases.
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Early phases address high-risk elements to fail fast if needed.
4. **Verification Gates**: Each phase has explicit entry and exit criteria.
5. **Business Alignment**: Phases align with business priorities and user needs.
6. **Technical Integrity**: Each phase maintains architectural and technical integrity.
7. **Continuous Integration**: Work is continuously integrated and tested.
8. **Knowledge Building**: Each phase builds upon knowledge gained in previous phases.
9. **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies between phases are clearly documented.
10. **Adaptability**: The phasing plan can adapt to new information while maintaining structure.

## üìã STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

Level 4 Complex System tasks typically follow a five-phase implementation approach:

```

### Dependency Management Strategies

1. **Vertical Slicing**: Implement complete features across all phases for priority functionality.
2. **Stubbing and Mocking**: Create temporary implementations to allow progress on dependent components.
3. **Interface Contracts**: Define clear interfaces between components to allow parallel development.
4. **Feature Toggles**: Implement features but keep them disabled until dependencies are ready.
5. **Incremental Integration**: Gradually integrate components as they become available.
