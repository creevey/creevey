# ARCHITECTURAL PLANNING FOR LEVEL 4 TASKS

> **TL;DR:** This document outlines a comprehensive architectural planning approach for Level 4 (Complex System) tasks, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture that aligns with business objectives and technical requirements.

## üîç ARCHITECTURAL PLANNING OVERVIEW

Level 4 Complex System tasks require thorough architectural planning to ensure the resulting system is robust, scalable, maintainable, and aligned with business objectives. This document outlines a structured approach to architectural planning that systematically addresses key concerns and produces comprehensive documentation.

## üìã ARCHITECTURAL PLANNING PRINCIPLES

1. **Business Alignment**: Architecture must directly support business objectives and user needs.
2. **Future-Proofing**: Architecture must anticipate future requirements and facilitate change.
3. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones when possible.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Systems should be divided into distinct components with minimal overlap.
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls should be employed.
6. **Loose Coupling**: Components should interact through well-defined interfaces with minimal dependencies.
7. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together, unrelated functionality separated.
8. **Resilience**: Architecture should anticipate failures and provide mechanisms for recovery.
9. **Scalability**: Architecture should support growth in users, data, and functionality.
10. **Measurability**: Architecture should enable monitoring and measurement of key metrics.

## üìã ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

Begin architectural planning with a comprehensive analysis of requirements:

### Functional Requirements Analysis
