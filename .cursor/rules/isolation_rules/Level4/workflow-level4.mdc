```

## 🚨 LEVEL 4 GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLE

Remember:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level 4 tasks represent ENTERPRISE-CRITICAL work.   │
│ RIGOROUS governance, comprehensive documentation,   │
│ and thorough verification are MANDATORY at each     │
│ phase. NO EXCEPTIONS.                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This ensures that complex systems are designed, implemented, and documented to the highest standards, with enterprise-grade quality and governance.
